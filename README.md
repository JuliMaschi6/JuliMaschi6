 ## Who am I?
 
 <p> I am a full stack developer, a year ago I found myself with the problem of choosing a career, when I was younger I always liked computers and technologies, with free time after high school a programming course took all my attention. As soon as I entered this world I realized that it was for me.</p>
 
 <p>I like teamwork and learn from others, I am a responsible and curious person.</p>
